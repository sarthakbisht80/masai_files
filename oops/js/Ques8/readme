Explanation

Global Scope

The user object is created with a property name = "Alice".

Inside printName

This method was originally written as an arrow function. Arrow functions do not have their own this; they inherit it from the surrounding scope (global context here). The global scope has no name property, so the output is undefined.

Output: undefined

Inside printName2

This method is a regular function. For regular functions, this refers to the object that calls the method. Since user.printName2() is called on the user object, this points to user and accesses name = "Alice".

Output: Alice

After Fix

If we change printName to a regular function, both methods behave the same way. Now this refers to the user object in both cases.

Output:
Alice
Alice
